# Extras

Scripts and tools that are not part of the robovision library, yet still useful.

These include:

* [auto_calibrate.py](autocalibrate.md) - Measure camera / lens parameters automatically, creating a pickled object that can be later used to remove lens distortions from captured images.
* get_colors.py - Determine the 5 most common colors (in both RGB and HSV spaces) in an image within the region selected by the user.
* more to come...
